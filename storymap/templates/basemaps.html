                Behind every great storymap is a basemap—literally!
            </p>
            <p> 
                The "basemap" for webmaps is the layer which shows land and water, roads and placenames. When we launched StoryMapJS, we included a few different <a href="http://maps.stamen.com">basemap options created by Stamen Design</a> and offered by them at no cost to you.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, it turns out that the cost to Stamen Design was considerable, so in 2023, they recognized that they could no longer afford to provide this service. <a href="http://maps.stamen.com/stadia-partnership/">They arranged with a company, Stadia, to take over hosting the maps.</a> 
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Unfortunately, this change is going to impact most storymaps which have ever been created.</strong> Stadia offers a limited free level of service for non-commercial use, but commercial users and non-commercial maps after a certain point need to pay a fee. 
            </p>
            <p>
                There's no way we can automatically switch existing storymaps that use the Stamen basemaps to use Stadia's instead. Even if you qualify for the free level of service, you need to <a href="https://stadiamaps.com/stamen/onboarding/create-account">create an account</a> and generate an <em>API key</em> so that Stadia can track usage. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Note that in the case of Stamen's watercolor basemap, a no-cost option appears to be available. In 2021 Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum <a href="https://www.cooperhewitt.org/2021/10/06/maptiles-by-stamen-design/"></a>acquired Watercolor Maptiles into its digital design collection</a>, and they <a href="https://watercolormaps.collection.cooperhewitt.org/#16/42.0556/-87.6741">make the tiles available</a> for use in digital maps. You can now choose <em>Cooper Hewitt: Watercolor</em> from the "map type" menu in the StoryMap options configuration.
            </p>

            </figure>            
            <p>
                Effective immediately, new storymaps will default to using the <em>OpenStreetMap: Standard</em> basemap. We won't change existing storymaps yet, but eventually, for maps that aren't updated, the Stamen basemaps will stop working. At some point, we'll change StoryMapJS to switch those to using OpenStreetMap instead, but we want people to have time to learn about this change and consider their options. We will likely change maps using the Stamen Watercolor basemap to use the Cooper Hewitt Watercolor basemap, instead of changing them to use OpenStreetMap. You can change your storymap yourself, at any time.
            </p>
            <p>
                Also effective immediately, StoryMapJS supports configuring your map to use Stadia maps—both the Stamen-designed maps, as well as others that Stadia has created. We also continue to support maps made with <a href="https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-studio">Mapbox Studio</a>, another commercial service which has a no-cost level.
            </p>
            <h3>Basemap options, in detail</h3>
            <p>Changing the basemap of your storymap happens in the <em>Options</em> panel. Open the panel by clicking on the button in the top left of the editor window. Basemaps are chosen using the <em>Map Type</em> menu.</p>
            <h4>OpenStreetMap: Standard</h4>
            <p><a href="https://openstreetmap.org" target="openstreetmap">OpenStreetMap</a> is often described as the Wikipedia of mapping. Their basemap layer is the default for storymaps. It is available at no cost, although the organization <a href="https://supporting.openstreetmap.org/">accepts donations and offers memberships</a>.
            </p>
            <h4>Cooper Hewitt: Watercolor</h4>
            <p>
                The Cooper Hewitt: Watercolor basemap is a no-cost option provided by <a href="https://watercolormaps.collection.cooperhewitt.org/#16/42.0556/-87.6741">Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum</a>. 
            </p>
            <h4>Gigapixel</h4>
            <p>
                <em>Gigapixel</em> is Knight Lab's term for StoryMaps made based on images instead of map data. Creating this kind of map requires some technical capability. Learn more on our <a href="/gigapixel/">Gigapixel page</a>.
            </p>
            <h4>Mapbox</h4>
            <p>Mapbox is a commercial map service provider.If you create an account with them, you can use <a href="https://www.mapbox.com/gallery/">their existing styles</a> or create your own using <a href="https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-studio">Mapbox Studio.</a> When you configure a storymap to use a Mapbox basemap, you will enter the "style URL" (which looks something like <code>mapbox://styles/nuknightlab/cikplzs9w00ddsykp7vqdz22u</code> and an <em>access token</em> created from your Mapbox account homepage.</p>
            <p>Mapbox charges for their service based on monthly usage, but have a "free tier" if your total usage is under a certain amount. Note that StoryMapJS only works with "raster" tiles, which shouldn't be an issue in most cases, although they are charged at a higher rate than newer "vector" tiles. We understand this isn't ideal, but changing StoryMapJS to use the newer format is a bigger technological effort than we are currently prepared to take on.</p>
